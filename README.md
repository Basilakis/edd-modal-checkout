# edd-modal-checkout

The plugin is created to allow you capture the user email, before theyr procced to the checkout page. That way, we can create advanced cart abadonded synquences even if they give up on checkout page!

To make it happen, use the following shortcode

[custom-edd-popup txt="Buy Now" class="pricing__button-full" downloadid="7947" priceid="" productname="Membership"]

Where
txt = The text of your Button
class = A class for your Button
downloadid = The ID of your product
priceid = if you are using variations
productname = A product name for your CRM / Tool to target the button
